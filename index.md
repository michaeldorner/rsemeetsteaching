# How to tap the minds of the brightest students for RSE?

Software underpins almost all research and is, in one way or another, at the core of scientific discovery today. We rely on high-quality and reliable software for high-quality and reliable results. Therefore, the engineering of such research software cannot be an afterthought. Research Software Engineering (RSE) bridges this gap between the complex demands of scientific research and the need for reliable, maintainable, and reliable software solutions for researchers. That makes us researchers and software engineers. 
But as researchers, we are also teachers. So the question comes naturally: How can we tap the minds of our brightest students for research software engineering?

In this experience report, we reflect on our approach to integrating research software engineering as part of the regular curriculum for software engineering students at Blekinge Institute of Technology, Sweden.
